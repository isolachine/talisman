The replace SIR object is a member of the Siemens suite of test subjects.
Originally this subject was written for execution under the Sun Microsystems
operating systems (SunOS and Solaris.)  While initially written and executed
on a SunOS4.3 platform and using an unknown compiler, we have found that one
of these inserted faults, v32, is no longer revealed.  When this subject was
originally packaged by the SIR 30 of the tests would reveal the v32 fault.
We can no longer recreate this fault's failing behavior on modern systems,
where it appears that no tests now reveal this fault.
