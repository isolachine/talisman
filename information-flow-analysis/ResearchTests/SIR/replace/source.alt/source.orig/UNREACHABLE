in makesub: 17 and 19 aren't reached.  Can't tell if unreachable,
            but Siemens didn't reach them.

in omatch: 9,11,12 are unreachable in base;
           19,56 are unreachable case default edges

in patsize: 4,6,7,27 are unreachable in base;
            9,10,12 are multi-case edges, reached and registered
            on edges 11 (for 9 and 10) and 13 (for 12)
            15,24 are unreachable case default edges

in Caseerror: the edges aren't reachable in base - handles the
            unreached case default edges from above; probably
            placed here to trap errors in the modified versions
