The version directories for this subject contain an additional file named
"v0.cov.universe.esc". This file contains the same test cases as the
file "v0.cov.universe.esc", except that the file has been converted to the
STImpL file format using escape sequences. You must use the new release
of the MakeTestScript tool on these files. This ensures that correct scripts
will be generated for both the C and Bourne shells. Other universe
files are only guaranteed to correctly generate C shell scripts.
