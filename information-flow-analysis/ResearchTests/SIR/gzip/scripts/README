Before you start an experiment, you should be done the following steps: 

1. Install mts
   Please download from subject page. 

2. Set environment variable experiment_root to point to the parent directory of
   the subject directory by typing "setenv experiment_root <path>"
   For example, assume you have a subject directory "gzip" and you locate
   it under /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments, then you would give the command:

        setenv experiment_root /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments

3. After installation of target version, create script using mts and
   run that script.

   Example:
        mts .. ../source/allfile ../testplans.alt/v0/v0.tsl.universe R scriptR0 
	NULL NULL
