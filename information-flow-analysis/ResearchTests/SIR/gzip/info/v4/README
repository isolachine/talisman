There are two fault matrix files delivered for this version of gzip
because the 1.3 version of gzip had a fault insertion bug with fault
FAULTY_F_KL_7.  Consequently, I reran the fault matrix generation
tool on this version and this is in the file fault-matrix.v0.tsl.universe

The other fault matrix found here, fault-matrix.v0.tsl.universe.orig
is the original fault matrix that was generated prior to locating the
fault insertion bug.  Also note that this original fault matrix only
activated 2 of the 12 faults listed for this version (in the FaultSeeds.h)
whereas the fault-matrix.v0.tsl.universe contains the matrix for all
faults found there.  I have not attempted to ascertain the exact faults
that were activated in that original fault matrix so if you need to
replicate those experiments you will need to compare the faults that
that were detected by which tests between the two matrices.

It should also be noted that 3 tests were removed from the v0.tsl.universe
used to generate these latest results.  The reason these tests were removed
is that the tests were causing false fault detections due to the way
that the shell handles redirection in from a non-existent or no-permissions
file.  As a result, the original and the modified versions of these
universe (STimpL) files are provided in the testplans.alt directory.
