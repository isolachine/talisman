These directories contain the test oracles for each version with the faults
inserted.  Within each directory there is two versions of the fault-matrix
files, essentially a new and original version.  The new versions were created
by executing the make-fault-matrix-with-names command (see SIR c-tools) on
the most recent (v1.4) version of the universe file.  The original versions
were the fault matrices delivered with the original artifact that was received
by the SIR.  These two differ in that the original artifact versions only
show a subset of the faults listed in the FaultSeeds.h files.  Since it is
nearly impossible to determine which faults were activated in the original
fault matrices the latest versions have all faults activated individually.
