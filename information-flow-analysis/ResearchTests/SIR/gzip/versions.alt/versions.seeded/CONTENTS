This directory contained the "variants" gzip source code.

v1 contain gzip-1.1.2 source code.
v2 contain gzip-1.2.2 source code.
v3 contain gzip-1.2.3 source code.
v4 contain gzip-1.2.4 source code.
v5 contain gzip-1.3 source code.

To build an instrumented source code, you open one of the directory.
Then, type "./catall.sh", this will create "allfile.c" a single 
source code for gzip. Next, type "make" to created an instrumented
version. The executable file will be "allfile.c.inst.exe".

If you didn't use the gzip source code provided, then your need to
read the "ChangeLog" before concatenated all the *.c files. Else,
your "allfile.c" can't be instrumented.
