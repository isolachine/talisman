Preferred install order
======================================================================================================

1. Setup llvm environment (follow llvm-setup-instructions)
    - Installs the necessary llvm and clang framework necessary for executing both parts of the analysis

2. Install the taint-analysis tool (follow taint-analysis-install)
    - Installs the pdg generation tool and its dependencies
    - Installs the taint analysis tool

    If you just want to install the taint analysis tool and re-run tests or prior analysis
    you can stop here as reference inputs are included in the test/ directory.

    If you want to create a new scenario completely follow the rest of the setup which
    shows how to run the constant analysis and how it was performed on linux.

3. Build linux bitcode files (follow linux-source-setup.txt)
4. Run the constant analysis (follow running-constant-analysis.txt)
